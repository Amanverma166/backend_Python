# FastAPI Backend with PostgreSQL

This project is a backend API built using FastAPI and PostgreSQL. It allows you to create, update, delete, and retrieve data from a PostgreSQL database.

## Features

- FastAPI for building the backend API
- PostgreSQL as the database for persistent storage
- CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
- Pydantic models for data validation
- SQLAlchemy for ORM-based interaction with the database

## Technologies Used

- **FastAPI**: Web framework for building APIs with Python 3.6+ based on standard Python type hints.
- **PostgreSQL**: Relational database management system.
- **SQLAlchemy**: Python SQL toolkit and ORM to interact with the database.
- **Pydantic**: Data validation library that works seamlessly with FastAPI.
